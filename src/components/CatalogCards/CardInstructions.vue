    <p>You can use this tool to create any kind of library card!</p>
    <p>
      I first created this silly little app in 2006 on my old WordPress blog.
      Since then, it's had over 20 million views and generated over 50 million
      cards. Who knew? Over the years, I've used it as a personal code kata to
      apply and practice new coding concepts I've learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply fill out the form with the content you want on the card and click
      the make button, or just watch some haikus and meditate for a while.
    </p>
    <p>Namaste!</p>
